"""Figures for the weight-movement distributions, from compare.py's CSVs.

Reads only the reduced CSVs, so the figures can be reworked without touching a
checkpoint again — the reduction is minutes per pair, this is instant.

EVERYTHING IS IN RAW UNITS. The three quantities involved span roughly 2,000x
(base weights sigma ~2.8e-2, the ES change ~7.0e-4, the RL change ~1.3e-5), so
no single linear axis can hold them. The answer used throughout is a log COUNT
axis with a shared raw x-axis, which lets a narrow distribution and a wide one
sit in the same panel honestly, plus separate panels where the ranges are too
far apart for even that. There is never a second x-scale in one panel.

Usage:
